# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction  

Predicting **customer churn** is one of the most important challenges faced by banks and financial institutions. This project builds machine learning models to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or continue using the bank’s services.  

The focus is not just on **accuracy**, but on **balancing recall and precision** — ensuring we correctly identify potential churn customers while minimizing false predictions.

## 🎯 Project Goals  

- **Understand and implement advanced ML models** for churn prediction.  
- **Focus on Recall & Precision** rather than just accuracy.  
- **Perform feature engineering** to extract meaningful patterns from raw data.  
- **Experiment with multiple models** and optimize hyperparameters for best performance.

## 📑 Approach  

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Understand dataset distribution, handle missing values, encode categorical features.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create meaningful features from customer history and transactions.  

3. **Model Selection**  
   - Train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
   - Experiment with advanced models (LightGBM, XGBoost, AdaBoost).  

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**  
   - Use grid/random search & automated tuning to maximize performance.  

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Prioritize **Recall** (to capture most churn cases).  
   - Balance with **Precision** (to reduce false alarms).  
   - Use **F1-score** as a combined measure.

## 📈 Results  

- Best model achieved:  
  - **Recall**: XX%  
  - **Precision**: XX%  
  - **F1-score**: XX%  

📌 *Insights*: Feature importance analysis showed that factors like `tenure`, `account balance`, and `number of products` were key predictors.  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

- Deploy the model with a simple **Flask/Streamlit app** for real-time churn prediction.  
- Incorporate **customer segmentation** to target interventions.  
- Explore **deep learning models** (LSTM/ANN) for sequential customer data.  

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways  

- Accuracy is not always the best metric in real-world imbalanced datasets.  
- Balancing **recall and precision** gives a more reliable churn prediction system.  
- Feature engineering and experimentation are often more impactful than just choosing the “best” algorithm.
